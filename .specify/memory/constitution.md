# Course-Creator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Multimedia Quality Excellence
All multimedia outputs must meet professional standards: high-resolution videos (1080p+), studio-quality audio, visually appealing graphics, and seamless integration. Content must be indistinguishable from premium Udemy-style courses.

### II. Cross-Platform Compatibility
The application must run flawlessly on all major desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), web browsers, and mobile devices (iOS, Android). Native performance and user experience on each platform.

### III. AI Integration Ethics and Privacy
Responsible use of LLMs and AI models via MCP protocol. User data privacy protected, content ownership clear, no unauthorized data sharing. Ethical AI practices in content generation.

### IV. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
100% test coverage required. TDD mandatory: Tests written first, approved, fail initially, then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. Automated testing for all features.

### V. Accessibility and Inclusivity
Support multiple languages for subtitles and audio. Ensure content is accessible to users with disabilities. Inclusive design principles for diverse user base.

### VI. Performance and Scalability
Efficient processing of video generation, audio synthesis, and multimedia rendering. Scalable architecture to handle large courses and concurrent users.

## Technical Constraints

Technology stack must support multimedia processing, AI integration via MCP, cross-platform deployment. Use modern frameworks for desktop (Electron/Tauri), web (React/Vue), mobile (React Native/Flutter). Database for course metadata, file system for assets.

## Development Workflow

Spec-driven development using GitHub Spec-Kit. Piece-by-piece implementation starting from core features. Regular reviews, quality gates at each milestone. Documentation and tutorials created alongside code.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require consensus and updated documentation. All decisions must align with these principles. Use this constitution for guidance in technical choices and implementation.
